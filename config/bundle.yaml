                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef   allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects   in any namespaces.

                            name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). \n
                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the
                            pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC
                            is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated
                            with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists.
                            Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful
                            when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. \n This

                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef   allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects   in any namespaces.
